                            During this past summer, I was an intern at ServiceNow on the Go-To-Market-Platforms team. Within my time there, I 
                            constructed a Resource Allocation Workbench (in JavaScript and SQL) in order to provide Resource Managers a platform to discover consultant availability
                            and directly make resource plans for different customers. Throughout this project, I gained the experience of planning
                            with both end-users and internal stakeholders, and overseeing how projects are managed in Big Tech. At the end of my internship, I got to 
                            present this project to Engineering leadership!

                            2 summers ago, I interned at Eightfold AI, an intelligence platform for
                            Talent Acquisition and Talent Management. I got the chance to work on some interesting projects using
                            really exciting technologies, namely with a suite of AWS Products like Lambda, S3, CloudWatch, Athena, Redshift, etc.
                            as well as Python and React. As part of the App Platform team, I got to contribute to improving the app developer 
                            experience, as well as creating resources to enhance applications built on AWS Lambda functions.

                        I learned about how Machine Learning backs data for different businesses by researching K-Means Clustering 
                        algorithms in Python. I also received the Domo Data Specialist certification for Business Intelligence.

                        I also got my first taste of enterprise-level code by doing Python code review and testing. In my last few weeks,
                        I organized a Meetup conference to talk about the usage and applications of AR and VR in the future.

                            was taking too long so I made an online chat messaging website called <strong>VChat</strong>
                            in order to be able to quickly login and send messages to your friends. This project was
                            a good experience in learning about authentication, as sending messages on VChat requires 
                            signing in with some sort of 3rd party account.

                            I made a tool where you can enter the name of any movie or show and find what platforms you can watch it

                            our Dex allows you to swap any existing crypto that you have in your wallet for any other coin on the Ethereum blockchain

                            emulated on a GPA device platform. I used DMA (direct memory access) and VBlank in order to directly draw images onto pixels on the 
                            screen. I had to create rendering methods for images, strings, and shapes, as well as the game logic for randomly placing
